## 🔍 What Does FaithBreak Do?

FaithBreak is a unique Minecraft plugin that helps players take breaks during prayer times:

- 🌍 **Smart Location Detection**: The plugin automatically detects each player's location based on their IP address
- 🕰️ **Prayer Time Awareness**: Calculates accurate prayer times for the player's specific location
- ⏱️ **Timely Reminders**: Two minutes before prayer time, players are gently kicked from the server
- ⏳ **Break Duration**: Players can't rejoin for 12 minutes, giving them time for prayer or a short break
- 🌐 **Universal Respect**: Non-Muslim players are also encouraged to take regular breaks for well-being

The plugin works silently in the background with zero configuration needed. It uses geolocation services and prayer time APIs to ensure accuracy across different regions and timezones.

## 🙏 Why I Made This

I made this plugin to help my fellow **Muslim brothers and sisters** stay on track with their **prayer times**.  
Let’s be real — it’s easy to get completely lost in Minecraft and forget 😅  
This plugin gives a gentle nudge at the right moment 🕌⏰

Also, fun fact: this plugin is **automatically bundled** with every plugin I make.
